# Problem Statement

My maid has 3 daughters and is the only earning member of her family. She has to manage her household expenses, along with the educational expenses of her children, keeping aside some funds for emergency situations(like medical emergencies). Somehow she managed to educate her children till high school but is unable to afford their education at the university level. But she also wants to make them financially independent. So, I talked to one of her daughters and came to know that she has interest in stitching but doesn’t know how to stitch clothes. So, at that moment I figured out that there are many such people, especially young women or home makers who want to contribute financially but can’t find the ways to learn those skills. So, I have created a mobile application for such women to help them gain relevant skills.

# Solution
Skill शाळा is a platform which will help women to get access to various courses which would help them gain skills and be financially independent. These courses would help them gain practical knowledge through video tutorials and offline workshops held in collaboration with NGOs and the government. 
1. The users will have to register on Skill शाळा with their mobile number, email id, name and a brief introduction about them. After login they will be able to explore the various courses and workshops available to start learning. 
2. A dedicated section will be available where the users would be able to book a counseling session by filling out a simple form, after which the counselors would help them take up a skill and start learning. It would be beneficial for the users who might be confused as to which skill they want to pursue and can seek guidance.
3. An FAQ section would be provided where the most common queries would be answered so that it becomes easier for the users to navigate through the application and take advantage of its features in the best possible manner.

# Target Audience
1. Young women who have done their basic schooling and are interested in learning with zeal and enthusiasm. 
2. Women who want to learn new skills and restart their career.

# Tech Stacks Used
1. Canva is used for designing the various frontend components.
2. Flutter framework using Dart programming language is used to develop the frontend of the application.
3. Firebase is used for the backend authentication of the users.
4. Firestore is the database used to store the user details.

# Future Scope
1. A portal would be created within the application where our users will be able to sell their products and generate income.
2. Skill शाळा would onboard mentors who would resolve doubts of our learners and make their learning process easy.
